### Hi there 👋

I am Angelos, a polyglot software engineer, based in Athens, Greece. 

When I am not writing and shipping reliable web applications, I like reading the history and basics of computer science. 

I am a firm believer of the compound gains of continually fixing the small things. 

⚡ Fun fact: I ♥ making playlists on Spotify. You can find the fruits of my labor on https://groove-mx.vercel.app
