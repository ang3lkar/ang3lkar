### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Angelos, a polyglot software engineer, based in Athens, Greece. 

When I am not writing and shipping reliable web applications, I like reading about software history and discovering new things while diving into the basics of computer science. 

I am a firm believer of the compound gains of continually fixing the small things. 

âš¡ Fun fact: I â™¥ making playlists on Spotify. I have written [cafe51](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cafe51/kbchbhcmhbplafabgblflanjcjgokgln?), a simple Chrome extension to help me on that. And you can find the fruits of my labor on https://groove.mx
