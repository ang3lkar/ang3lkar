### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Based in Athens, Greece. I am a polyglot programmer and seasoned front-end engineer. And a firm believer of the compound gains of continually fixing the small things. I am interested in reliable backend stacks, modern front-end technologies and shipping reliable applications.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I â™¥ making playlists on Spotify. You can find them on https://groove.mx
